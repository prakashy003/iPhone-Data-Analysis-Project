# iPhone-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Overview
This project is a learning exercise aimed at exploring different approaches to data analysis using:

Python (Pandas) for data processing and manipulation
SQL for querying and managing structured data
Snowflake for cloud-based data warehousing and analytics
The goal is to analyze iPhone-related data (e.g., sales trends, specifications, pricing patterns) and compare how different tools handle data operations.

Objectives
✅ Learn how to clean, transform, and analyze data using Pandas
✅ Write optimized SQL queries to extract insights from structured datasets
✅ Explore Snowflake's cloud-based data storage and analytics capabilities
✅ Compare performance, ease of use, and scalability across these methods

Why This Project?
By implementing the same analysis using Python, SQL, and Snowflake, I aim to understand:

The strengths and limitations of each approach
Best practices for data engineering and analysis
How cloud platforms like Snowflake enhance scalability
Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Snowflake
Next Steps
Collect and preprocess the iPhone dataset
Perform initial analysis using Pandas
Load data into a SQL database and run queries
Move data to Snowflake and compare results
Document key insights and learnings
