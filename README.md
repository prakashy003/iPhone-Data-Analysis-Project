# iPhone-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Overview
This project is a learning exercise aimed at exploring different approaches to data analysis using:

Python (Pandas) for data processing and manipulation

SQL for querying and managing structured data

Snowflake for cloud-based data warehousing and analytics

The goal is to analyze iPhone-related data (e.g., sales trends, specifications, pricing patterns) and compare how different tools handle data operations.

Objectives

✅ Learn how to clean, transform, and analyze data using Pandas

✅ Write optimized SQL queries to extract insights from structured datasets

✅ Explore Snowflake's cloud-based data storage and analytics capabilities

✅ Compare performance, ease of use, and scalability across these methods


Why This Project?
By implementing the same analysis using Python, SQL, and Snowflake, I aim to understand:

1. The strengths and limitations of each approach   
2. Best practices for data engineering and analysis    
3. How cloud platforms like Snowflake enhance scalability    


Steps Involved:
1. Collect and preprocess the iPhone dataset
2. Perform initial analysis using Pandas
3. Load data into a SQL database and run queries
4. Move data to Snowflake and compare results
5. Document key insights and learnings
